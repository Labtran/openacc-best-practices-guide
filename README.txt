OpenACC Porting and Portability Guide
=====================================
This guide is written in Pandoc markdown format
(http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html). 

The build.bat file may be used to generate a PDF once Pandoc and a LaTex
package are installed or the command may be modified to generate on
another platform.

FIXME 
-----
* The implicit_figures feature is disabled until I can determine how to
  make the figures inline rather than lumped together at the end. This
  may simply be an issue of a differen LaTeX -> PDF converter.
* Need to look into installing filter for internal figure references.
* Need to generate SVG diagrams instead of PNG.
