Efficient Loop Ordering
-----------------------

Mapping Parallelism to the Hardware
-----------------------------------
* Gang clause
* Worder clause
* Vector clause
* Seq clause

Collapse Directive
------------------

Tile Directive
--------------
***NOTE: I'm tempted to leave this off because I've yet to find a case where it
was beneficial.***
